  2007-03-04  guido
  
    * Free up internal memory allocated before we throw an exception
    
    * Throw ArgError and RangeError exceptions rather than Runtime exceptions
    
    * Don't return an inconsistent semacode when presented with overlong input
    
    * Don't fail quietly either, throw an exception
    
    * Very conservatively use a far smaller maximum value for input length than the header file suggests
